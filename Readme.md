## The Double Wolf - Artwork

> An app using Backbone models and collections to fetch data (my artwork and its properties) from Parse to put on screen.

> The title and year are strings, the medium is an array, and the Sold/Available for Purchase lines are booleans (see artwork_template.js for if statement that creates this).

> Demonstrates basic understanding of how to use a REST API and BaaS (backend as a service).
